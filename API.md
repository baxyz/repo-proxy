### Other Package Formats

This proxy currently supports **APT repositories**. Support for other package formats (RPM, etc.) may be added in the future based on community needs.

To request support for additional package formats, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/baxyz/repo-proxy/issues).

## Response Formats

All endpoints return appropriate content types:

- APT metadata: `text/plain`
- GPG signatures: `application/pgp-signature`
- GPG keys: `application/pgp-keys`
- Health check: `application/json`

## Security

### GPG Signature Verification

All APT repository metadata is cryptographically signed with GPG:

1. **InRelease**: Clearsigned Release file (recommended by APT)
2. **Release.gpg**: Detached signature for legacy compatibility
3. **Public Key**: Distributed via `/apt/public.gpg.key`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Authenticity verification
- ✅ Integrity protection
- ✅ MITM attack prevention
- ✅ APT native signature checking

**Setup**:
See [APT GPG Setup Guide](docs/APT_GPG_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Caching

All metadata is cached at the edge for optimal performance while maintaining security through GPG signatures.

## Notes

- Only AMD64 architecture is supported (Proton packages are amd64-only)
- All requests are cached for optimal performance
- The service acts as an intelligent proxy to official Proton repositories
- GPG signatures generated automatically via GitHub Actions CI/CD
